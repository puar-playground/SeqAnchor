## Goal
We will use the ASM network structure to learn a set of patterns that captures biological sequence homology and use the model to do multiple sequence alignment. The model will be trained in an unsupervised way by manipulating the 3rd and 4th standardized moments of the channel activation distribution. Patterns are forced to find their best matches on different inputs in the same order without overlapping.
